# Preprocess folder
In this folder are placed all the files related to the pre-process of your system.   
Here, you can take care of the standardisation, scaling, etc. of your dataset before sending it to the model.  
It is also here that you can create the PyTorch **DataLoader** object. An example is given in *data_loader.py*.
