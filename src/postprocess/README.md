# Postprocess folder
In this folder are placed all the files related to the post-process of your system.   
Here, you can take care of processing performed on the prediction given by the model.  
You can also prepare all the visualisation tools necessary to analyse your results (plotting, confusion matrix, etc.).  
An example of a confusion matrix is given in **result_display.py**.
